### Hello, my name is Shepard

I find my self constantly meeting new people and repeating the same introductory questions:

- What's your name
- What do you do
- What do you want to do

The first question is always expected and appreciated. I mean how many times do you start a conversation, and you're already talking politics or war crimes committed in the 1940s.

> (Me) Hey man, how's it going, my name is Shepard

> (Stranger) I agree, we should build a time machine and go back to WW2 and meet him

Now you have to stand there confused as you wonder who **him** is. At least the conversation has become interesting. The simple name response can be brutal. I say my name, you say your name, now we just stand here awkwardly until one of us decides to ask the second question. As you should, you ask the next question.

This is where conversations go to die.

> (Stranger) I'm currently studying for my Bachelor's in Computer Science/Engineering

This is my world. These are the response that I get. And that is **fine**. I say that I am doing something similar, and now we are in the car driving. There is gas in the tank and the road is clear. I know who he is, I know what he likes to do by what he is doing, now let's try to relate over some common ground.

> (Me) What do you think about (insert literally any computer thing here)

> (Stranger) Well, it doesn't really interest me.

Brother, what interests you. It's like pulling teeth for some people to try and uncover why they chose a CS degree.
